Subject: i386: increase X86CPUDefinition::model_id to 49
Commit-Id: 807e9869b8c4119b81df902625af818519e01759

The original commit comment in 807e9869b8c4119b81df902625af818519e01759:

i386: Change X86CPUDefinition::model_id to const char*

It is valid to have a 48-character model ID on CPUID, however the
definition of X86CPUDefinition::model_id is char[48], which can
make the compiler drop the null terminator from the string.

If a CPU model happens to have 48 bytes on model_id, "-cpu help"
will print garbage and the object_property_set_str() call at
x86_cpu_load_def() will read data outside the model_id array.

We could increase the array size to 49, but this would mean the
compiler would not issue a warning if a 49-char string is used by
mistake for model_id.

To make things simpler, simply change model_id to be const char*,
and validate the string length using an assert() on
x86_register_cpudef_type().
----

However in order to simplify things, in backport we just increase
model_id to be of type char[49] because else we need quite some
other patches to be backported too.
